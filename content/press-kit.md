## Electronic Press Kit

No Such Animal is a home recorded rock band that started in Utah. The band consists of Finn Morrison (frontman, vocals), Jacob Golden Ward (drums), Cole Harris (guitar), Ella Morrison (keys), and Seth Jensen (bass). They put energetic riffs and catchy melodies together to create a unique blend of almost every rock subgenre.

Their next release will be “Milk + Honey”, a hard-hitting punk-rock anthem that resonates with a near-universal frustration with being let down by society. It’s the lead single from their upcoming album, “I’m Not Angry, You’re Angry.”

No Such Animal regularly performs across Utah and in nearby states, playing in Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Logan, St. George, and at festivals such as Fork Fest and Buzzards & Bees. Following the success of their single, “Witches in Salt Lake City,” they released “The Entertainer,” an album about making sense of things in a world of witches, spacemen and cyborgs. Their music has amassed over 2,000,000 streams.
