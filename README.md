The website for the band No Such Animal. Built with Hugo and Tailwind CSS

As of right now, I'm running Hugo and Tailwind separately — Hugo just notices changes to the output.css file generated by Tailwind using the Tailwind CLI:

```
pnpm tailwindcss -i themes/no-such-theme/assets/css/input.css -o themes/no-such-theme/assets/css/output.css --watch
```

Then when running

```
hugo serve
```

in another shell, everything works pretty well for the moment.
